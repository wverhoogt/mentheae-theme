<p>Welcome to B&amp;B Mentheae. A cozy, spacious attic guest room. Comfortable, fully equipped and very close to Haarlem train (and buss-) station.</p>

<p>It is a very old house, this means that the stairs are narrow and steep. Please take into consideration that large trunks won't fit ;).</p>

<p>It costs € 85 per night to stay with us for up to 2 persons. 9% VAT and € 6.25 pp tourist tax are included in the price. As is breakfast. There is a sofa bed in the room, an extra person costs € 25 per night.</p>

<p>Check-in is between 10:30 and 18:00 h. I am sorry, we cannot make an exception to this. Check-out is before 12:00 h. If you like, you can leave your luggage for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Breakfast is served between 08:00 and 10:00 h.</p>
