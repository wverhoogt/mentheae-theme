==
<p>We own a fantasy shop "De Groene Godin", which means "The Green Goddess" and we live above it. Our attic is converted into a comfortable guest room. The name Mentheae is chosen because this a sort name for many green herbs and plants, which in our opinion is a good fit to The Green Goddess.</p>
